# Library-Resource-Usage-Analysis
I completed this project as part of my semester 5 coursework. I collected data from students using a Google Form and conducted a data analysis to understand their library usage, including their preferred time for going to the library, types of books they read, are they satisfied with internet speed and library timings etc.
